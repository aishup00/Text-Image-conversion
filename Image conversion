# Text–Image to Audio Conversion using OCR 🎤📷

## 📝 Overview
This project extracts text from images using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** and converts it into natural-sounding speech.  
Built as an accessibility solution for **visually impaired users** and general users who need hands-free reading.

## 🚀 Features
- Extracts text from any image (PNG, JPG, Scanned documents)
- Uses **Tesseract OCR** for accurate text recognition
- Converts text to speech using **gTTS**
- Supports multiple languages
- Simple and clean UI (if GUI is used)
- Saves audio output as `.mp3`

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Pytesseract (OCR)  
- gTTS (Text-to-Speech)  

## 📂 Project Flow
1. Load Image  
2. Preprocess (grayscale, thresholding, noise removal)  
3. Run through OCR  
4. Convert extracted text → audio  
5. Save or play audio  

## 📸 Example Output
- Input: Image of a paragraph  
- Output: `output_audio.mp3`

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
pip install opencv-python pytesseract gTTS
python main.py
